Design overview
===============

In this chapter we will have a brief view on the design of *h5cpp*. We will 
not dive into the details here but hopfully provide enough insight into the 
concepts behind *h5cpp*. 

.. attention::

    If you are new to *h5cpp* please read this chapter carefully as it is the 
    basement for everthing else in this manual. If you do not understand the 
    terminology introduced by this chapter it is most probably difficult 
    to understand the rest of the manual.
